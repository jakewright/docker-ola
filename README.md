# docker-ola
Simple docker-container to run [ola](https://github.com/OpenLightningProject/ola) (olad = server variant). Since this software is kind of tricky to compile I used docker to do the job in a reproducible way. 

# this branch contains support for usb-devices

# PLEASE NOTICE
If you're reading this on (https://hub.docker.com) or (https://store.docker.com): I'm using the docker-services here just as a glorified "build-service". This project lives on [github](https://github.com/s1lvester/docker-ola), so Issues should be brought up there.

# Usage:
I recommend you use the docker-compose.yml.
